# HOURLY TASKS (Recommended to be run multiple times per day, if possible)
# At a minimum these tasks should be run daily.
#--------------
 
# Regenerate DSpace Sitemaps every 8 hours (12AM, 8AM, 4PM).
# SiteMaps ensure that your content is more findable in Google, Google Scholar, and other major search engines.

#----------------
# DAILY TASKS
# (Recommended to be run once per day. Feel free to tweak the scheduled times below.)
#----------------
 
# Update the OAI-PMH index with the newest content (and re-optimize that index) fout times a day
# (This ensures new content is available via OAI-PMH and ensures the OAI-PMH index is optimized for better performance)
0 9,12,15,19 * * * $DSPACE/bin/dspace oai import -o > /dev/null
 
# Clean and Update the Discovery indexes at midnight every day
# (This ensures that any deleted documents are cleaned from the Discovery search/browse index)
0 0 * * * $DSPACE/bin/dspace index-discovery > /dev/null
 
# Re-Optimize the Discovery indexes at 12:30 every day
# (This ensures that the Discovery Solr Index is re-optimized for better performance)
30 0 * * * $DSPACE/bin/dspace index-discovery -o > /dev/null
 
# Cleanup Web Spiders from DSpace Statistics Solr Index at 01:00 every day
# NOTE: ONLY NECESSARY IF YOU ARE RUNNING SOLR STATISTICS
# (This removes any known web spiders from your usage statistics)
0 1 * * * $DSPACE/bin/dspace stats-util -i
 
# Re-Optimize DSpace Statistics Solr Index at 01:30 every day
# NOTE: ONLY NECESSARY IF YOU ARE RUNNING SOLR STATISTICS 
# (This ensures that the Statistics Solr Index is re-optimized for better performance)
30 1 * * * $DSPACE/bin/dspace stats-util -o
 
# Send out subscription e-mails at 02:00 every day
# (This sends an email to any users who have "subscribed" to a Collection, notifying them of newly added content.)
0 2 * * * $DSPACE/bin/dspace sub-daily
 
# Run the media filter at 03:00 every day.
# (This task ensures that thumbnails are generated for newly add images,
# and also ensures full text search is available for newly added PDF/Word/PPT/HTML documents)
0 3 * * * $DSPACE/bin/dspace filter-media  | grep -v SKIPPED | grep -v FILTERED
 
# Run any Curation Tasks queued from the Admin UI at 04:00 every day
# (Ensures that any curation task that an administrator "queued" from the Admin UI is executed
# asynchronously behind the scenes)
# 0 4 * * * $DSPACE/bin/dspace curate -q admin_ui
 
#----------------
# WEEKLY TASKS
# (Recommended to be run once per week, but can be run more or less frequently, based on your local needs/policies)
#----------------
# Run the checksum checker at 04:00 every Sunday
# By default it runs through every file (-l) and also prunes old results (-p)
# (This re-verifies the checksums of all files stored in DSpace. If any files have been changed/corrupted, checksums will differ.)
0 4 * * * $DSPACE/bin/dspace checker -l -p
  
# Mail the results of the checksum checker (see above) to the configured "mail.admin" at 05:00 every Sunday.
# (This ensures the system administrator is notified whether any checksums were found to be different.)
0 5 * * 0 $DSPACE/bin/dspace checker-emailer
 
#----------------
# MONTHLY TASKS
# (Recommended to be run once per month, but can be run more or less frequently, based on your local needs/policies)
#----------------
# Permanently delete any bitstreams flagged as "deleted" in DSpace, on the first of every month at 01:00
# (This ensures that any files which were deleted from DSpace are actually removed from your local filesystem.
#  By default they are just marked as deleted, but are not removed from the filesystem.)
0 1 1 * * $DSPACE/bin/dspace cleanup > /dev/null
 
#----------------
# YEARLY TASKS (Recommended to be run once per year)
#----------------
# At 2:00AM every January 1, "shard" the DSpace Statistics Solr index.
# This ensures each year has its own Solr index, which improves performance.
# NOTE: ONLY NECESSARY IF YOU ARE RUNNING SOLR STATISTICS
# NOTE: This is scheduled here for 2:00AM so that it happens *after* the daily cleaning & re-optimization of this index.
